<h2> About Me: </h2>
<p> Hello, my name is Arpan Patel. I am from India and I moved to Chicago in 2009 because my parents a better opportunity for education in 
	the United States. I went to Maine East High school and Oakton Community college for two years. I went to Oakton Community college to explore what
	I wanted to study and after taking couple of programing classes I figured I would like to get a degree in Computer Science. This is my first year at 
	DePaul University and currently enrolled in Computer Science program was lucky enough to get an internship at Maine East High School. I love playing cricket 
	during summer, tennis, going to gym, and watching TV.</p>

<h2>Curve of Forgetting:</h2>
<p> The article “Curve of Forgetting” is about how brains can stored information if we review it often after learning the new information.
	In this article, it gives us example how we learn new information and if we don’t review for a while then it will take extra time to relearn 
	when you see it next time.Therefore, when you see it next time you will have to re-learn from the scratch. Basically, this article is giving 
	advice on how to keep information stored in our brains by reviewing for certain amount time after receiving it. 
	Thank you professor for sharing this article. I will start doing this for all of my classes and see the result at end of the quarter. </p>
